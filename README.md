# mine_sweeper_java
By Dwayne Kirby

## Project Overview
This is a simplistic mine sweeper game based in Java. It allows for the user to play a version of mine sweeper revealing one square at a time. 

## Rules
Just as regular mine sweeper, the rules apply if you uncover a mine you lose, if you uncover all tiles that are not mines you win
